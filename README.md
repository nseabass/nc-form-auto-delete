# nc-form-auto-delete
A simple script to delete Nextcloud Forms responses older than a certain number of days

## Disclosure: This was mostly vibe-coded (AI generated/assisted). I am an end user, not a coder. I did review and debug the code significantly to get it working in the current state, but I am not a knowledgable developer. I'd rather *not* use AI but I don't have the necessary skills to make something like this currently. Implementation of this as a feature of Forms was marked as Maybe Someday, and I unfortunately needed it today (well, this week).
